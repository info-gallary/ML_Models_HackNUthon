# ML_Models_HackNUthon

## 🚀 Project Overview

**ML_Models_HackNUthon** is my first machine learning project that predicts human activities using sensor based past data (Nisarg's Samsung Watch) and suggests actions accordingly. It also includes a stock price prediction model that considers election outcomes (like Modi winning) as a key factor.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Human Activity Recognition**: Uses sensor data to predict movements and provide recommendations.
- **Stock Market Prediction**: Analyzes historical data and election impact on stock trends.
- **Automated Planner**: Suggests actions based on predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python
- **ML & AI**: Scikit-Learn
- **Frameworks**: Tkinter, Streamlit
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib

## 🔥 Innovations
✅ **Election Impact on Stocks** – Uses political events as predictive factors.  
✅ **Smart Activity Planner** – Provides suggestions based on user behavior.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Built with Tkinter and Streamlit for easy interaction.
